# KA-BLAOW!

Bluetooth should not be so goddam hard to toggle.

## You wanted an easy way to turn Bluetooth on and off. You're heavy on eassy. And now you have it.

This Alfred workflow is as simple as a round object beside another round object. (balls)

1. Install *blueutil* from Frederik (http://www.frederikseiffert.de/blueutil/) because he rules and enables this to workenstein.
2. Have Alfred (http://www.alfredapp.com) because it lets your mouse hand do actual work instead of dragging its heels about all day, building calluses on its hand-ass.
3. Use this .alfredworkflow.  If you're legitimately on Step 3, you know how to double-click or the like.

Bluetooth should not be so goddam hard to toggle.
