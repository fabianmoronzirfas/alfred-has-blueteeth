# KA-BLAOW!

Bluetooth should not be so goddam hard to toggle.

You wanted an easy way to turn Bluetooth on and off. You're heavy on easy. And now you have it.

This Alfred workflow is as simple as a round object beside another round object (such as balls).

1. Install *blueutil* from Frederik (http://www.frederikseiffert.de/blueutil/) because he rules and enables this to workenstein.
2. Have Alfred (http://www.alfredapp.com) because it lets your mouse hand do actual work instead of dragging its heels about all day, building calluses on its hand-ass.
3. Use this .alfredworkflow.  If you're legitimately on Step 3, you know how to double-click or the like.

Bluetooth should not be so goddam hard to toggle on your Mac, your iPhone, or unywhere.
