# KA-BLAOW!

## You wanted to turn Bluetooth on and off?!

Now you can in 9 or 10 keystrokes. Easy!
And you're heavy on easy.

### Bluetooth should not be so goddam hard to toggle.

#### This Alfred workflow is as simple as a round object beside another round object (such as *balls*).

1. Install *blueutil* from Frederik (http://www.frederikseiffert.de/blueutil/) because he rules and enables this to workenstein.
2. Have Alfred (http://www.alfredapp.com) because it lets your mouse hand do actual work instead of dragging its heels about all day, building calluses on its hand-ass.
3. Use this [.alfredworkflow] (https://github.com/krry/alfred-has-blueteeth/blob/master/Toggle%20Bluetooth.alfredworkflow).  If you're legitimately on Step 3, you know how to contextual-click or the like â€” hint: save this shit and use it to ease your troubled mind.

Bluetooth should not be so goddam hard to toggle on your Mac, your iPhone, or unywhere.  Also, if you have a Mac, and like keyboards, you should not be without Alfred.  That's just effing stupid. Cuz Alfred buttled Batman.
